# etch-a-sketch

#description

This is a simple program that aims to emulate a virtual etch-a-sketch.

In terms of functionality, the tool will have three toggle checkboxes; pencil/eraser, mode dark/light, marker small/medium. The tool will also allow the user to choose marker color from a hex palette. Lastly it will have a reset board button. 

#steps

----------STAGE 1: BASIC VISUAL SETUP----------

1. Map out how the tool will look. ✔

2. Create a very basic visual prototype of the tool using HTML & CSS. ✔

----------STAGE 2: FUNCTIONALITY----------

3. Dynamically create a grid of divs. 

4. Create a checkbox that changes the grid size on check.

5. Write a "marker" function that: when a div is clicked and dragged through, it turns black. 

6. Create a button which resets the grid to white when clicked.

7. Write a function that: allows the user to input a hex value which determines the color used in "marker".

8. Create a checkbox that, when checked, forces "marker" to output black, irrespective of hex color selection.

9. Create a checkbox that changes the color mode of the tool from dark to light on check.

----------STAGE 3: POLISH INTERFACE----------

10. Turn all checkboxes into toggle buttons & style all buttons.

11. Adjust fonts, div placements, margins, and padding.
